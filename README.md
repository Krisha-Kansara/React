A fun and interactive timer-based game built with React that tests your sense of time! ⏱️

🧠 How it works:
Users must start and then stop the timer as close to the target time as possible.

Each challenge (like Easy - 1 second or Not Easy - 5 seconds) offers a different difficulty.

Your performance is evaluated based on how accurately you stop the timer.
